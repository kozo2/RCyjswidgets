Cytoscape Network Charts
================

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

A HTMLWidget wrapper for the [Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/)
graph / network visualisation and analysis library. There are already a
number of existing `R` packages for Cytoscape such as the [Bioconductor
package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RCy3.html)
and the official [Cytoscape
Widget](https://github.com/cytoscape/r-cytoscape.js). The purpose of
this package is to make the process of producing a chart as simple as
possible.
